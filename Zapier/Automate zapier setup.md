
Zapier can connect to Power Automate using webhooks or HTTP requests, and you can integrate Power Automate Desktop (PAD) flows using their run URLs and IDs. Here's how you can set up these connections and integrations to streamline your workflow:

Connecting Zapier to Power Automate via HTTP Requests
Step 1: Set Up Power Automate Flow with HTTP Trigger
Create a New Flow in Power Automate:

Go to Power Automate, create a new flow, and select the "Instant cloud flow" option.
Choose the "When an HTTP request is received" trigger.
Define the JSON schema for the data you expect to receive.
Generate the HTTP Request URL:

Save the flow to generate the unique HTTP request URL.
Note this URL as it will be used in Zapier to send HTTP requests.
Step 2: Configure Zapier to Send HTTP Requests
Create a New Zap in Zapier:

Go to Zapier and create a new Zap.
Set the trigger based on your requirements (e.g., new email, new row in Google Sheets, etc.).
Add Webhooks by Zapier Action:

Add an action and choose "Webhooks by Zapier".
Select the "Custom Request" option.
Configure the request with the following details:
Method: POST
URL: Paste the Power Automate HTTP request URL.
Headers: Set any necessary headers (e.g., Content-Type: application/json).
Data: Include the JSON payload to send to Power Automate.
Test and Activate the Zap:

Test the Zap to ensure the data is correctly sent to Power Automate.
Activate the Zap once testing is successful.
Integrating Power Automate Desktop Flows
Step 1: Identify PAD Flow Run URL and ID
Locate the PAD Flow:
In Power Automate Desktop, open the flow you want to run.
Obtain the run URL and the flow ID from the flow's properties or settings.
Step 2: Trigger PAD Flow from Zapier
Create a Webhook or HTTP Request in Zapier:
Similar to the previous steps, create a new Zap in Zapier and set up the trigger.
Add a "Webhooks by Zapier" action with the following configuration:
Method: POST or GET (depending on the flow's requirement).
URL: Use the PAD flow's run URL and include the flow ID in the query parameters or URL path as required.
Headers: Set any necessary headers.
Data: Include any required data or parameters to run the PAD flow.
Example Unified Workflow
Here is an example workflow integrating Gmail, Google Sheets, Power Automate, and Power Automate Desktop using Zapier:

Email Collection:

Prompt: "Set up a Zap to trigger when a new email is received in Gmail, extract the relevant data, and add it to a Google Sheet."
Zapier Actions:
Trigger: Gmail: New Email
Action: Google Sheets: Create Spreadsheet Row
Data Processing with Power Automate:

Prompt: "Send data from the new row in Google Sheets to a Power Automate flow via HTTP request."
Zapier Actions:
Trigger: Google Sheets: New Spreadsheet Row
Action: Webhooks by Zapier: Custom Request (POST to Power Automate HTTP request URL)
Running Power Automate Desktop Flow:

Prompt: "Trigger a Power Automate Desktop flow using its run URL and ID."
Zapier Actions:
Add another action: Webhooks by Zapier: Custom Request (POST to PAD flow run URL with the flow ID)
Data Storage and Reporting:

Prompt: "Store processed data in a local network folder and generate a report in Google Docs."
Local Script: Use VS Code and Node.js/Express to handle data storage and report generation.
Notification and Logging:

Prompt: "Send an email with the report and log details in Obsidian."
Zapier Actions:
Action: Gmail: Send Email
Action: Webhooks by Zapier: Custom Request (to log in Obsidian using Advanced URI)
Example Prompt to GPT
Here is a comprehensive prompt to set up this workflow:

markdown
Copy code
I want to automate a complex workflow using Zapier AI actions, Power Automate, Power Automate Desktop, and other tools. The workflow involves the following steps:

1. **Email Collection**:
   - Trigger: New email received in Gmail.
   - Action: Extract data from the email and add it to a Google Sheet.

2. **Data Processing with Power Automate**:
   - Trigger: New row added to Google Sheets.
   - Action: Send data to a Power Automate flow via HTTP request for processing.

3. **Running Power Automate Desktop Flow**:
   - Action: Trigger a Power Automate Desktop flow using its run URL and ID.

4. **Data Storage and Reporting**:
   - Store processed data in a local network folder.
   - Generate a report in Google Docs.

5. **Notification and Logging**:
   - Send an email with the report attached.
   - Log the report creation and email details in Obsidian.

Please set up the necessary Zaps, REST APIs, and scripts to achieve this workflow. Provide detailed instructions for any manual steps required for setting up integrations and local resources.
By following this structured approach, you can create a cohesive and automated workflow that integrates various tools and services, allowing you to manage everything from one place efficiently.

Ok, first thing first then, creat a prompt for the gpt to ensure proper access has been given on all AI actions available.  Then to get all files from all folders in my OneDrive Business, make a copy of each and store them in a new folder I will create called GPT.  A zap should then be set up to copy any new file saved in my OneDrive to the gpt folder.  Modifications to existing should also be copied over to overwrite the existing.
